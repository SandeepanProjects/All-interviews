Structuring a large-scale iOS application—especially with multiple teams and feature modules—requires a scalable, maintainable, and modular architecture. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this:

---

## 🔧 1. **Adopt a Modular Architecture**

### **Why Modular?**

* Decouples features, enabling parallel development.
* Improves build times (especially with SwiftPM or Bazel).
* Makes testing and CI pipelines easier.
* Enables feature toggling and code reuse.

### **How to Structure**

At the top level:

```
App/
├── AppTarget (e.g., MyApp)
├── Core/
│   ├── CoreNetworking
│   ├── CoreUI
│   ├── CoreAnalytics
│   ├── CoreDataModels
├── Features/
│   ├── FeatureLogin
│   ├── FeatureProfile
│   ├── FeatureFeed
│   └── FeatureSettings
├── Shared/
│   ├── DesignSystem
│   ├── Utilities
│   └── Localization
```

---

## 🧱 2. **Define Clear Module Boundaries**

Each module should:

* Have a single responsibility.
* Expose only necessary public APIs (via `internal` and `public` access control).
* Communicate via protocols and dependency injection.

For example:

* `CoreNetworking` handles all HTTP logic and is used by other modules via interfaces.
* `FeatureLogin` contains only login-related UI, ViewModels, and Coordinators.

---

## 🧭 3. **Use Coordinators for Navigation**

Avoid tight coupling between view controllers by using the **Coordinator pattern**. Each feature module can have its own coordinator:

```swift
protocol ProfileCoordinating {
    func showEditProfile()
}
```

* Coordinators live within modules and are instantiated by the main app or a higher-level flow controller.

---

## 🔗 4. **Use Dependency Injection (DI)**

Avoid singletons for global dependencies. Use a DI framework (like **Needle**, **Swinject**, or **Factory**) or manual dependency injection to pass around:

* Networking clients
* Persistence
* Feature flags
* Analytics

This improves testability and makes modules interchangeable.

---

## 🧪 5. **Enforce Testing and CI Rules per Module**

Each module should have its own test target:

* `FeatureLoginTests`
* `CoreNetworkingTests`
  This enables modular testing and faster CI.

---

## 👥 6. **Team Ownership and Code Ownership**

Define team ownership per module:

* Team A owns `FeatureLogin`, `FeatureProfile`
* Team B owns `FeatureFeed`, `CoreNetworking`
  Use GitHub CODEOWNERS files to enforce this.

---

## 🧰 7. **Tools and Package Management**

* Prefer **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** for internal module boundaries.
* Use **Xcode Workspaces** or **Bazel** for better performance in large codebases.
* Use `xcconfig` files or a build system like **Tuist** for scalable config management.

---

## 🛡️ 8. **Feature Flags and A/B Testing**

Use tools like **LaunchDarkly**, **Firebase Remote Config**, or a custom flag manager to:

* Toggle features per user, environment, or version.
* Gradually roll out new features.

---

## 📄 9. **Shared Design System and UI Components**

Build a `DesignSystem` module with:

* Reusable buttons, colors, typography
* UI theming
  This keeps your UI consistent and makes changes easy to propagate.

---

## 🏗 Example Module Dependency Graph

```plaintext
AppTarget
├── FeatureLogin
│   └── CoreNetworking
├── FeatureProfile
│   └── CoreDataModels
├── FeatureFeed
│   ├── CoreNetworking
│   └── CoreAnalytics
├── DesignSystem
```

---

## 🚦 Summary

* **Modularize by feature and domain**
* **Use coordinators and DI for navigation and dependency management**
* **Set clear ownership per module**
* **Adopt shared infrastructure modules for consistency**
* **Use tools that scale with team size and build complexity**
