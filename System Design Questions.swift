Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of **System Design interview questions** tailored for **iOS developers** (especially mid to senior level), including general mobile architecture and SwiftUI-specific concerns.

These are grouped into:

---

## ðŸ§± 1. **General System Design for Mobile Apps**

These questions test your ability to architect scalable, maintainable mobile applications:

1. **How would you design a scalable chat application (e.g., WhatsApp)?**
2. **Design a ride-hailing app (like Uber). What components would you need?**
3. **How would you design push notification handling in a mobile app?**
4. **How do you handle offline support and synchronization in an iOS app?**
5. **How would you structure an app that supports multiple user roles (e.g., admin, user)?**
6. **What is your approach to modularizing a large iOS app?**
7. **How would you handle secure authentication in a mobile app?**
8. **How would you architect an iOS app for multi-platform (iOS, watchOS, macOS) support?**
9. **What patterns or principles do you follow for scalable app architecture (MVVM, VIPER, Redux, etc.)?**
10. **How would you handle background tasks, uploads/downloads, and retries?**

---

## ðŸ§­ 2. **SwiftUI-Specific System Design Questions**

1. **How would you design a SwiftUI app that consumes multiple APIs with different data models?**
2. **How do you manage app-wide state in SwiftUI across many screens?**
3. **How would you handle dependency injection in a SwiftUI app?**
4. **How do you structure a SwiftUI project to be testable and modular?**
5. **How would you design a reusable and dynamic form engine in SwiftUI?**
6. **How do you architect a SwiftUI app that works well with Combine and async/await?**
7. **How would you design SwiftUI views that load and cache images efficiently?**
8. **How do you implement a design system (theming, spacing, typography) in SwiftUI?**
9. **How would you architect navigation in a SwiftUI app that supports deep linking and restoration?**
10. **How do you coordinate SwiftUI with UIKit components or legacy modules?**

---

## ðŸ›  3. **Infrastructure & DevOps-Aware Design**

Especially relevant in **senior or full-stack iOS roles**:

1. **How would you design logging and crash reporting in a mobile app?**
2. **How would you roll out features gradually (feature flags, A/B testing)?**
3. **How would you secure sensitive data on device and during transmission?**
4. **How would you design your app to be CI/CD-ready?**
5. **How do you handle app versioning and migrations (e.g., database)?**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 4. **Behavioral/System Design Hybrid**

1. **Describe a time you had to refactor or re-architect a large feature. What was your approach?**
2. **Have you built any shared libraries or frameworks for multiple apps or teams?**
3. **How do you collaborate on architecture decisions with backend and product teams?**

---

## âœ… Want to Practice?

I can:

* Simulate a **mock system design interview**
* Help you **answer specific questions**
* Or sketch out system design **diagrams** (like a chat app or news feed)

Let me know how you'd like to prepare.
