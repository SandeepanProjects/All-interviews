Optimizing app launch time on iOS is crucial for delivering a fast, responsive user experience ‚Äî Apple recommends that apps launch in **under 400 ms** for a good user perception.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the techniques you can use:

---

## üöÄ 1. **Understand App Launch Phases**

There are 3 key stages:

1. **Pre-main time**: Before `main()` is called.
2. **main() to `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`**.
3. **Post-launch UI setup**.

You want to reduce time spent in **all** of these.

---

## üìè 2. **Measure First with Instruments**

Use **Xcode Instruments** > **App Launch** template:

* Identify what‚Äôs taking time.
* Track CPU, I/O, and memory usage during startup.

> üîç Run with `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS` to profile pre-main phase.

---

## üß† 3. **Minimize Work in `AppDelegate` / `@main` / `SceneDelegate`**

* **Avoid heavy operations** like:

  * Networking
  * Database reads
  * Heavy logging
* Offload to background queues using `DispatchQueue.global()` or `Task {}`.

‚úÖ Example:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .task {
                    await preloadData()
                }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üßπ 4. **Defer Non-Critical Work**

Anything not essential to the **first screen** should be **deferred**:

* Analytics setup
* Remote config fetching
* Prefetching assets
* Session validation

‚úÖ Use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline:)` or lazy initialization.

---

## üì¶ 5. **Optimize Asset Usage**

* Large images, storyboards, or fonts delay launch.

  * Use **vector assets** or **SF Symbols** where possible.
  * Prefer **lazy loading** for large assets.
* Use **Asset Catalogs** with optimized image compression.

---

## üíæ 6. **Reduce Dependencies / Framework Bloat**

* Remove unused frameworks and SDKs.
* Avoid SDKs that perform heavy operations on launch (e.g., logging, analytics).
* Use **static libraries** where appropriate to reduce dynamic loading time.

---

## üß∞ 7. **Enable On-Demand Resources (ODR)**

* Load non-critical assets **after launch**.
* Ideal for games or content-heavy apps.

> Requires configuration in the Asset Catalog and server setup.

---

## üß± 8. **Use SwiftUI Efficiently**

* Keep your root view light.
* Avoid complex view builders or `ForEach` loops in `ContentView`.
* If you need to load data, use `.task {}` instead of blocking the UI.

‚úÖ Example:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isReady = false

    var body: some View {
        if isReady {
            MainAppView()
        } else {
            SplashView()
                .task {
                    await preload()
                    isReady = true
                }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## ‚õìÔ∏è 9. **Optimize Pre-Main Time**

Use static analysis and reduce:

* **Static initializers**.
* **Heavy global variables** or `@StateObject` initialization at top level.

‚úÖ Replace this:

```swift
let heavyModel = HeavyModel() // Static initializer (runs pre-main)
```

üö´ With:

```swift
lazy var heavyModel = HeavyModel() // Initialized when needed
```

---

## üìâ 10. **Remove or Defer Storyboard Launch Screens**

* Storyboards are parsed at runtime = slow.
* Use a **static launch screen** from `LaunchScreen.storyboard` with only:

  * Background color
  * App logo
  * Minimal layout
* Don‚Äôt use auto layout, constraints, or stack views in launch storyboard.

| Technique                      | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Defer heavy work**           | Move non-essential logic post-launch         |
| **Use lightweight launch UI**  | Avoid complex views in initial screen        |
| **Reduce asset weight**        | Optimize images/fonts, use SF Symbols        |
| **Offload to background**      | Use `DispatchQueue` or `Task` for async work |
| **Profile with Instruments**   | Find real launch bottlenecks                 |
| **Avoid static initializers**  | Prevent slow pre-main execution              |
| **Simplify launch storyboard** | Make it static and minimal                   |
| **Remove unused frameworks**   | Lighter binary = faster load                 |
